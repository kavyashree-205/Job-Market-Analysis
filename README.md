# Job-Market-Analysis

The Job Market Analysis project involves utilizing web scraping techniques using the Beautiful Soup library to extract data from [times.jobs.com](https://www.timesjobs.com/). The extracted data includes company names, experience, locations, skills and posted date. The job listings are based on the provided role/designation.

The analysis is concluded by finding out 3 things
1. What years of experience are employers looking for?
2. List of top 30 on demand skills for the specific role
3. Which locations offer better opportunities for the specific role?
